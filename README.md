# Modularization of legacy code

## What is modular programming?

According to Wikipedia, [modular programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) is a programming technique aimed at dividing the IT system into independent, exchangeable modules so that each module contains all the necessary elements to perform a specific functionality.


## What does the module contain?
1. The module consists of two parts:
    - interface of the module;
    - implementation of the module;

2. The module interface defines what the module does.

3. The implementation of the module determines how the module interface is implemented.

4. The division of the module into the interface and implementation is very beneficial for both the system user (client) and the implementing person (molue's provider).
